			<p class='text-muted-foreground'>
				Computer science by training, data science by profession, MBA by transformation. Currently leading data science at Starbucks—customer behavior modeling, experimentation at scale, and turning analysis into executive decisions.
			</p>
			<p class='mt-4 text-muted-foreground'>
				I build things in my spare time because it keeps me sharp and makes me a better leader. You can't credibly push your team toward new tools if you haven't felt the learning curve yourself.

		<Section title='Projects'>
			<p class='text-muted-foreground'>
				I build full-stack data products from scratch—experimentation platforms, analytics pipelines, interactive tools. Each project is a learning lab where I'm the architect and AI handles the scaffolding.
